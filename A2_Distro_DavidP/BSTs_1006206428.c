/*
  CSC A48 - Assignment 2 - BSTs, Traversals, a tiny Sequencer

  For this assignment you will be implementing a fully working
  BST. The goal is for you to gain practice with one of the most
  common and more useful data structures you can find.

  The data we will store in the BST corresponds to musical notes
  from a little song, and we have provided (in a separate .c
  file) a very small implementation of a program to making 
  sounds from each of these musical notes.

  ** YOU DO NOT NEED TO look at that code
  ** Everything in 'NoteSynth.c' is provided
  ** just so you can listen to the data in your
  ** BST - but you do not need to look at it for
  ** this assignment, and you're not expected 
  ** to learn or understand that code.

  You can, however, learn from it if you're curious about how
  sound can be synthesized. Don't spend time on that unless you
  have completed everything else.

  Read carefully the comments and descriptions in this starter
  code, as they constitute the specification of what you need
  to do to complete the assignment.

  - Like A1, we will provide a test driver for you to test your
    code. Also like A1, that test driver contains a subset of the
    tests we will be running. You are responsible for running 
    additional tests to ensure your BST works properly!

    // BST. Since the BST is used to store musical notes, 
    // the data contained here represents one note from a
    // musical score:
    // freq: A double-precision floating point value, 
    //       corresponding to the frequency (pitch) of the note
    // bar: Musical scores are divided into 'bars' (which you can
    //      see are actually separated by a vertical bar!). This
    //      value indicates which bar the note happens in. The
    //      first bar in the musical score is 0
    // index: Position of the note within the bar, from 0 (at the
    //        beginning of the bar) to 1 (at the end of the bar)
    // key: A unique identifier (remember we discussed BST nodes
    //      should have unique keys to identify each node). We
    //      want our nodes to store notes in the order in which
    //      they occur in the song. So, the key identifier is
    //      created as: key = (10.0*bar)+index

    //            bar,index value. If two notes should happen
    //            at the same time in the song, we make the
    //            index of one of them a tiny bit bigger or
    //            a tiny bit smaller than the other one so
    //            their keys are very close, but not identical.

     * This function traverses the BST, and for each existing
     * note, inserts a new, modified note (i.e. it will add sounds
     * to an already existing song, based on the notes it already has)
     * 
     * The new note has the followin properties:
     * - The frequency is shifted by the specified number of semitones
     *   (A semitone is the difference between one note and the
     *    immediately next one in the musical scale - ot what is the
     *    same, the difference in pitch between a white key and the
     *    black key immediately next to it in a piano)
     * - It plays in the same *bar* as the original note
     * - But its *index* is shifted by the specified time_shift
     *   (this value is between 0 and 1, but you have to check 
     *    that the final index remains between 0 and 1)
     * 
     * Both the 'semitones' and 'time_shift' parameter can be
     * positive or negative. A typical value for semitones
     * could be 4 or 7, corresponding to musical 3rds or
     * musical 5ths - this should produce some interesting
     * harmony! but you can play with this function and try
     * various things for fun.
     * 
     * In practice, figuring out the frequency of the note
     * you have to insert is easy. For instance, suppose
     * you have an existing note in  the BST with
     * 
     * freq=440.0, at bar=10, index=.25
     * 
     * Now suppose the user specified
     * 
     * semitones=4
     * time_shift=.1
     * 
     * Then you go to the note_freq[] array, find the index
     * of the entry for frequency 440.0 (let's say it's 
     * j), then go to note_freq[j+4] to find the frequency
     * of the note you need to add.
     * 
     * NOTE: If the value of  j+semitones  is < 0 or > 99
     *       then there is no note with the frequency you
     *       want. In that case you don't insert a new
     *       note. ***(CASE 1 when not to insert)***
     * 
     * You then add a new note with that frequency at
     * bar=10 (same bar!)
     * index=.25 + .1  (the original index plus the time_shift)
     * 
     * NOTE: If the resulting index is less than 0, or >= 1,
     *       then you DO NOT insert the new note. ***(CASE 2 when not to insert)***
     * 
     * This function is crunchy - and if you don't think it 
     * through before you start implementing it you'll run into
     * all kinds of trouble.
     * 
     * This is the problem solving exercise for A2, so don't
     * look for people on Piazza to give you answers, or tell you
     * what to do, or verify you're doing the right thing.
     * 
     * It's up to you how to solve this, and if you want an opinion,
     * you can come to visit us during office hours!
     * 
     * Expected result: The BST will have about twice as many notes
     *   as before, and the new notes are shifted in pitch and 
     *   in time as specified by the parameters.
